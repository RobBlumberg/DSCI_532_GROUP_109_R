### Introduction

To promote a respectful, safe, inclusive, and enjoyable working and learning environment, DSCI 532 Group 109 (“Group 109” or “Team”) of the University of British Columbia Master of Data Science program (“MDS”) has established a Code of Conduct (“Code”) that defines expectations for the individual and collective behaviour of its members (“Member”; collectively “Members” or “We”):

- Robert Blumberg
- Trevor Kwan
- George Thio 

The Code applies to all activities associated with UBC course DSCI 532 irrespective of time, location, activity, and form of communication within the Team or with external counterparties. The words and actions of each Member reflect upon the Team as a whole and as such we expect Members to speak and act in a manner which upholds and adheres to the Code when representing the Team.


### Statement of Values  

Group 109 is committed to creating and maintaining a supportive working and learning environment for its Members and stakeholders which includes but is not limited to fellow MDS students, MDS faculty, teaching teams and administrators, and any other external parties with which Members may engage when representing the Team.  

We oppose and prohibit any form of communication or behaviour within the Team or with stakeholders which excludes, physically or mentally intimidates, or causes others to feel unwelcome or unsafe. Exclusionary communication and behaviour encompasses both acts of commission and omission.  

We oppose and prohibit any form of discrimination or harassment within the Team or with stakeholders including but not limited to those based race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, religion, nationality, physical appearance, citizenship, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religious belief (or lack thereof), wealth, age, educational attainment, professional experience, and socio-economic status.  


### Expected Behaviour  

Members are expected to conduct themselves in a courteous, respectful, and professional manner during all Team related activities and communications. Model behaviour in keeping with the Statement of Values includes but is not limited to the following examples:  

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Tolerating and accepting different viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive feedback and critique
- Placing the needs of the Team ahead of any individual Member
- Accommodating different Member working habits, communication styles and schedules 
- Organizing inclusive Team events which consider the personal needs and preferences of each Member (e.g. alcohol, religious, dietary restrictions, venue)
- Actively seeking opportunities to help Members learn and grow  


### Prohibited Behaviour 

Harassment and prohibited behaviour by Team Members includes but is not limited to the following examples as they pertain to the Team and its stakeholders (“Others”):  

- Any form of open or private communication causing Others to feel excluded
- Any action causing Others to fear for their safety such as stalking or intimidation
- Any display of sexual or violent images to Others
- Any non-consensual or unwelcome sexual attention towards Others
- Any non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact with Others
- Any sustained disruption of Team activities or communications
- Any inducement of incitement of Others to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- Any non-consensual interaction with Others including photography, video recording, and voice recording


### Incident Reporting and Resolution

Given the difficulty of exhaustively identifying all undesirable behaviours, and for the avoidance of doubt over any incident which may be construed as harassment or prohibited behaviour, the claim of the offended party shall be given precedence in the context of the spirit and broad scope of the Statement of Values.

Members or stakeholders who believe they have been offended by a breach of the Code should first attempt to resolve the matter directly with the offending Member who is expected to take immediate action to cease and desist to the satisfaction of the offended party. If resolution is not achieved, the offended Member should inform all Team Members of the breach to seek a Team resolution. If resolution is not achievable amongst the Team, the Team shall formally escalate the matter to the DSCI 532 teaching team by sending an email to firas.moosvi@ubc.ca.

If a Member is uncomfortable pursuing the suggested incident reporting and resolution guidelines, he should directly inform the DSCI 532 lecturer by sending an email to firas.moosvi@ubc.ca and is under no obligation to inform other Team members.

For incidents which are raised to the DSCI 532 teaching team for review, the offending Member agrees to be subject to any sanctions imposed by the teaching team which will be asked to determine whether the incident constitutes a breach of the Code.
