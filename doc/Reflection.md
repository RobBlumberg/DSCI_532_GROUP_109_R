After milestone 3 feedback from peers and TA, we decided to implement some changes and not implement others.

We decided to implement five peer-recommended changes: reposition the dropdown bar for deck level, change the font size of note about adjusting the browser, change the color of bars in the horizontal bar chart, change the default deck level, and add a note for the tooltip.
We decided NOT to implement four peer-recommended changes: add a note or label to show that the square shape in the titanic visualization represented an empty cabin, show which cabins belong to which class on each deck level, change the word “location” to “deck level”, and decreasing the size of the titanic image.

We were also working on implementing audio in the form of the popular Titanic theme song towards the end of milestone 3 but needed to be debugged for R at the time. 

(more on whether or not the music worked out)

In milestone 4, we received 2 suggestions from TA feedback. 

First, it was suggested that we link our class plot graph (association between class and survival rate) better with the other two graphs because it is currently unclear whether or not first, second, or third class passengers would be located on decks. This feedback was very similar to peer feedback we received in milestone 3, suggesting us to “show which cabins belong to which class on each deck level”. However, we concluded in milestone 3 that we were not able to visually implement this on the plot itself because the available data indicates only where first-class cabins are located and we had no information on location of the other classes. The TA’s concern is a little different, that users would not know passengers of a certain “class” would belong on certain “decks”. We decided that users should be able to assume that passengers of classes belong on decks and no clarification should be necessary. 

Second, it was suggested that we should consider shortening and sorting our commit messages using [DOC] = for documentation updates, [ENH] = for added functionality or interactivity, or [BUG] = for bug fixes. We decided not to implement that changes to maintain consistency of commit communication. Because we did not shorten our commit messages in prior milestones and have been able to communicate effectively, we concluded no change in communication should be implemented as this stage of the project.
