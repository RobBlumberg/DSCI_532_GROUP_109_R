After milestone 3 feedback from peers and TA, we decided to implement some changes and not implement others for the reasons explained in the previous reflections document:

We decided to implement five peer-recommended changes:  

1. Reposition the dropdown bar for deck level   
2. Change the font size of the note about adjusting the browser  
3. Change the color of bars in the horizontal bar chart  
4. Change the default deck level  
5. Add a note for the tooltip

We decided NOT to implement four peer-recommended changes:  

1. Add a note or label to show that the square shape in the titanic visualization represented an empty cabin  
2. Show which cabins belong to which class on each deck level  
3. Change the word “location” to “deck level”  
4. Decrease the size of the Titanic image

We have been unable to solve the audio problem for our music file which was to be played when a user lands on our dashboard as Heroku is unable to find the file.


In milestone 4, we received 2 suggestions from TA feedback:   

First, it was suggested that we link our class plot graph (association between class and survival rate) better with the other two graphs because it is currently unclear whether or not first, second, or third class passengers would be located on decks. This feedback was very similar to peer feedback we received in milestone 3, suggesting us to “show which cabins belong to which class on each deck level”. However, we concluded in milestone 3 that we were not able to visually implement this on the plot itself because the available data indicates only where first-class cabins are located and we had no information on location of the other classes. The TA’s concern is a little different, that users would not know passengers of a certain “class” would belong on certain “decks”. We decided that users should be able to assume that passengers of classes belong on decks and no clarification should be necessary. 

Second, it was suggested that we should consider shortening and sorting our commit messages using [DOC] = for documentation updates, [ENH] = for added functionality or interactivity, or [BUG] = for bug fixes. We decided not to implement that changes to maintain consistency of commit communication. Because we did not shorten our commit messages in prior milestones and have been able to communicate effectively, we concluded no change in communication should be implemented as this stage of the project.
